## Getting Started

The UI may not be intuitive to users other than Republic of Korea soldiers.

The Goondae website consists of three main features that are useful to soldiers in Korea.
1. Vacation Planner
2. Date/Salary calculator
3. Monthly Menu

### Vacation Planner

To use the Vacation Planner, users must sign up and log in.

### Monthly Menu

I would've had to change the UI if I were to translate all of the menu into English,
so the menu is only shown in Korean.

### Main Page

All of the information above shows on the main page.
Only users with accounts can use the main page
